For 'Naver Arrival Guaranteed' products, the optimal bundle group is calculated to meet the arrival date, and the seller cannot select a shipping bundle group. (You can only select whether bundled delivery is possible or not) Guaranteed arrival products have a silent group randomly generated by the system, so they are not grouped in the same bundle group as general delivery/today departure products. (Even if the products are from the same logistics center, the buyer guarantees arrival. & When purchasing regular delivery/departure today products at the same time, guaranteed arrival products are separated into a separate bundle group.) ※ Note.· If the buyer purchases both regular delivery and today departure products at the same time, they will be delivered as standard shipping.· The shipping cost bundle group is This is the standard for charging shipping fees to buyers, and the final packaging/separate packaging of delivery boxes is determined by the logistics company's policy. · If free shipping products are included among bundled group products, the final shipping fee is free even if there are products that require shipping fees.

[Fulfillment] How is logistics company inventory linked?,"If the Naver Fulfillment logistics company is CJ Logistics, Poomgo, Pasto, Our Box, or Argo, the inventory of the logistics company is linked. Therefore, the inventory quantity cannot be set arbitrarily for the products of the five logistics companies. 1.

Inventory linking method: The system automatically links based on the product number (or option management code). (Semi-real-time linking) Before linking, the inventory quantity is displayed as 'before linking' on the product modification page and product list, and the product status is 'out of stock'. Afterwards, when the inventory information is linked, the inventory quantity is automatically updated and the product status is 'out of stock'. It will automatically change to ‘On Sale’. ※ Note. · Smart Sto's product number (or option management code) must be uploaded to the inventory information of the logistics company's system for the inventory to be properly linked. · The method of uploading inventory information to the logistics company's system is different for each logistics company, so it is linked.

Why is that so?,"The delivery memo is displayed in the same way for both the main product and additional product, but if the buyer checks to use an individual delivery memo on the order form, a separate note can be created for each 'option and additional product'. In other words, if the buyer sets an individual delivery memo through the order form and does not enter a separate delivery note for some products (optional or additional products), only the entered delivery message will be displayed.

"In the case of a partial return, is the initial shipping fee also refunded?","If you order multiple products in your shopping cart and a partial return is made, whether or not the initial shipping fee will be refunded depends on the reason for the return. If the reason for the return is the buyer's fault (cancellation of purchase intent, etc.), the initial shipping fee may change due to a partial return. If it has to be deducted, the initial shipping fee will be refunded after deducting it from the product price. If the reason for the return is the fault of the seller (product damage, etc.), if the initial shipping fee changes due to a partial return and must be refunded, the initial shipping fee will be refunded in addition to the product price. Example 1) When the initial shipping fee is not deducted when the buyer refunds (the changed initial shipping fee is borne by the seller) ① Conditional free shipping (shipping fee KRW 2,500/free for purchases over KRW 20,000) Order 2 product options (KRW 10,000 each) ② Afterwards, the buyer returns one product due to 'product damage (seller's fault)' → If it is the seller's fault, the initial shipping cost must be borne by the seller, so the buyer's refund is KRW 10,000 without deducting the initial shipping cost (only the product amount is refunded)※ Note. Under the same conditions, if a partial return is made due to the buyer's fault, KRW 7,500 will be refunded after deducting the initial shipping fee.

Therefore, since the initial shipping fee is not refunded to the buyer, the buyer's refund is 17,000 won※ Note. If a partial return occurs due to the seller's fault under the same conditions, the seller will be responsible for the responsibility, so the initial shipping cost equivalent to the refunded quantity will be refunded to the buyer.

If payment is made at a discount from the sales price due to the use of a coupon such as an instant discount, the commission is reflected as follows. . If the seller sets an instant discount and the payment is made at a discounted amount, a commission is charged based on the final payment amount provided with the instant discount. Example) If the sale price is 10,000 won / the instant discount is 1,000 won, the buyer applies the instant discount of 1,000 won. Therefore, since the actual payment amount is 9,000 won, the fee is charged at 9,000 won. If payment is made using a coupon issued by the seller, the benefit will be applied regardless of the type of coupon and a fee will be charged based on the final payment amount.Example) If a sales price of 10,000 won / a 1,000 won discount coupon is issued and used, product duplicate discount coupon /All store cart discount coupons → The fee is charged from the KRW 9,000 paid after applying the coupon.※ Note. However, in the case of sales-related commissions, the commission charging standards vary depending on the type of coupon issued by the seller. Store shopping cart discount coupon: A commission is charged based on the amount before applying the coupon (when applying the above example, a commission is charged from 10,000 won) · Product duplication Discount coupon: A fee is charged based on the amount paid after applying the coupon (when applying the above example, charged from 9,000 won). If payment is made using a coupon (product discount coupon) paid by Naver, the payment fee is applied regardless of the type of coupon. A fee is charged based on the applied and final payment amount. In the case of sales-related fees, the fee is charged based on the amount before coupon application.

For detailed VAT reporting subjects and reporting payment period, please contact the National Tax Service. Please check on the website.※ Note. Overseas businesses can check their value-added tax return details and electronic tax invoice issuance details, but they are not subject to value-added tax reporting or issuance of tax invoices because they are considered zero-tax and are not subject to separate taxes in Korea.

Q. Does the VAT report data include the ‘Value-Added Tax’ amount? The VAT report data is data that includes VAT based on the payment amount, not the amount settled. Additionally, the sales amount in the VAT reporting menu refers to the final amount paid by the buyer through Naver Pay, not the amount settled by Naver Pay. (Including commissions, VAT, and shipping costs) Q. All sales amounts in the VAT reporting data (sales data) are exposed as tax-exempt. Even though it is a taxable product, the reasons why it is exposed as tax-exempt in the sales data are as follows.① ‘Simplified VAT 'Business' is issued tax-free.

[Marketing History] The expected number of targets and the actual number of recipients are different.,"The number shown when confirming targeting is an 'estimated number', so it may differ from the actual number of transmission targets. The estimated number may be a duplicate count (not duplicated during transmission), or the customer's conditions may be different at the time of actual transmission. It may change and transmission may not be possible. Example: If you operate multiple stores and there is overlap between customers in each store.) When sending a marketing message to the sending stores (A, B), if customer A sets up to receive notifications from both stores: Expected number of targets: 2, actual sent Number of targets: 1 person (Example if there is a change in the number of customers at the time of setting up reservation delivery and the number of delivery targets at the time of actual delivery) Set reservation delivery of marketing message (8/17) to the target of product purchase induction targeting on 8/15 (Estimated number of targeting: 100) People → On 8/17 when it was actually sent, re-confirm and send out the 100 people who have a favorite product. If the number of messages that can be sent is insufficient When reserving a message, please keep in mind that the number of messages that can be sent is insufficient at the time of actual sending. Example. ) At the time of reservation for message '(a)', the expected number of targets is 100 and the remaining number of free transmissions is 50. In this case, the system reserves 50 free transmissions and 50 paid transmissions, and 50 paid transmissions at the time of reservation. Payment will be processed. However, if you have used up 50 free items with another message '(b)' before the actual sending date of message '(a)', on the day of sending the reserved message '(a)', the number of free sending items is not enough, so the number of paid possible sending items you paid for is insufficient. Only 50 items are sent randomly, so the ‘actual number of recipients’ is 50. If your Biz Wallet balance is insufficient, payment for paid messages is made at the time you set up sending the message. In the case of reservation messages, you must check whether your Biz Wallet balance is sufficient at the time of reservation. Biz Wallet balance charged after reservation cannot be used to pay for previous reservations. Example) You are trying to send message '(a)', but it can be sent for free. Since the number of cases is 0, it must be sent for a fee (estimated target number of 5,000, Biz Wallet balance 11,000 won). In this case, it will be sent randomly to 1,000 people with a Biz Wallet balance of 11,000 won. Even if you recharge your Biz Wallet after reservation (even before the actual shipping date), it has nothing to do with message '(a)'.

Frequently asked questions about statistical services,"Q1) Whether it is possible to provide additional information other than the information provided in the BizAdvisor statistics report or the cause/reason for indicator changesA) BizAdvisor statistics does not provide additional data or check data status other than the data provided in the report. In addition, we will check the meaning/definition of the indicators displayed in the report and whether there are any problems, but we are unable to provide guidance on the reason/cause of indicator changes as it is realistically difficult to determine and is not accurate. In addition, data that has passed the report data retention period (usually 18 months) cannot be viewed in the BizAdvisor statistics report, and please understand that it is difficult to provide it separately. Q2) Scope of sites where BizAdvisor statistics are provided A) BizAdvisor statistics are available on specific sites. /This is a statistical service provided from the store’s perspective. (Even if there is one account, if there are multiple sites (channels), information is provided separately by site where the product is sold.) The types of sites for which BizAdvisor statistics are currently provided are as follows, and reports are provided for the number of sites for each type. - (Ⅰ) Smart Store main site (https://smartstore.com/OOO)- (Ⅱ) Brand Store (https://brand.naver.com/OOO)- (Ⅲ) Example of shopping window) Users using Smart Store If the seller owns one Smart Store and two Shopping Windows, there are a total of three sites that can be searched in the report.※ Note. From the Shopping Live operator's perspective, the statistics flowing into the Shopping Live service are provided separately as [Shopping Live statistics], so please use the [Shopping Live administrator page]. From the BizAdvisor statistics provided in the Smart Store Center to Shopping Live Information about accessed inflow is not provided. However, if you click on a product while watching Shopping Live, the product detail page appears as a layer. In this case, it is considered inflow from Shopping Live to Smart Store and the inflow number is calculated from BizAdvisor statistics. (In this case, the name of the marketing channel is [Custom] channel, and is displayed as the value [nt_source=nshoplive] in the statistical [Marketing Analysis > Custom Channel] report.) Q3) Shopping promotions through external promotional means, Are inflow indicators provided when landing on an event page? A) BizAdvisor statistics provide information such as (inflow) marketing channel and number of inflows on how to directly inflow to the store (smart store, shopping window). Shopping promotions, event pages, etc. are not smart stores or shopping windows, so promotional methods imported into shopping promotions or event pages are not counted as inflow. (However, access to the store from a shopping promotion or event page is counted as inflow.) Q4) If a landing is made to Shopping Story from an external promotional means, will it be counted as inflow, and will payment conversions, etc. also be counted? A) Shopping Story is an internal page of Smart Store. no see. Therefore, when landing on Shopping Story, it is recorded as an inflow, and when payment occurs, payment conversion is also recorded. Q5) What do the bottom (other) items on the horizontal bar chart mean? - How can I get information about things that are not displayed on the chart screen? Can you confirm? A) In the horizontal bar chart, there is a limit to the number of items that can be displayed on the screen, so the exact item names are shown up to a certain number (usually 15), and the rest are displayed in the (Other) category. For example, if there are a total of 30 paid products, and this product information is displayed in a horizontal bar chart according to the payment amount, the product name is displayed accurately for the top 15th place, and for the 16th to 30th place, the value is added to the (Other) item. Displayed on the chart as one horizontal bar. Since the details of products in the (Other) category cannot be confirmed through the chart, they can be checked through the table at the bottom of the report with the corresponding chart or by downloading Excel. Q6) The phrase ‘Information is not provided for personal information protection due to a small amount of payment information for the period viewed.’ is displayed, and part or all of the report is not visible. Why is this?​​A) The above message may appear in some reports, and it appears when the number of payments in the report is less than 40. In this case, personal information (male/female, age, other user profile) No charts or tables appear. ■ ​Reports where the above message can be exposed: 5 reports: [Summary > E-Commerce Summary], [Sales Analysis > Product/Demographics, Product/Customer Profile, Product/Region], [Marketing Analysis > Demographics] In this case, the report can be viewed only when the number of payments is 40 or more, so please try increasing the viewing period so that the number of payments is more than 40.※ Note. This measure is taken to protect the personal information of people who visited or paid. Please understand. Q7) The same product may appear more than once in the report table. Why is that so? A) When providing information through the current table, if the product category, product name, and product ID are all the same, it is displayed as one line. If any of these three pieces of information are different, they are separated into different lines. In many cases, the product name changes during the period selected in the report, so the product ID is the same, but it is often divided into two or more lines. Q7) In [Summary > Real-time Report], the inflow number is There are times when the number of visitors is higher. A) In [Summary > Real-time Report], all visitors are measured regardless of 'direct inflow', but inflow is measured except for 'direct inflow', so if there is a lot of 'direct inflow', the number of visitors is greater than the inflow. This happens often.※ Note. What is direct inflow? Technically, this is a case where there is no referrer at the time of inflow, and generally, the site URL is entered directly in the browser, or through a link in a smartphone app (e.g. KakaoTalk, etc.), or through favorites.

Sales Analytics Frequently Asked Questions,"Q1) In the table of the report, products with the same product ID appear in multiple rows. - One product ID is displayed divided into multiple rows. A) Product-related statistics include product category, product name, and product at the time the report is created. It is created by considering the ID together. If the product name and product category are different for one product ID each time the report is created, it is displayed divided into multiple rows in the table. These symptoms may appear in the [Sales Analysis > Product Performance] and [Shopping Behavior Analysis > By Product] reports. Q2) The data in the BizAdvisor statistical [Sales Analysis] report and the data in the Smart Store Center [Sales Management] area do not match. I think so. What should I do? A) ① If you have multiple sales channels (sales sites) The general screens related to Smart Store Center [Sales] (+Delivery) provide information about all sales channels (sales sites). (Example: Sales Management > Order Integrated Search) On the other hand, BizAdvisor statistics provide information by site (=sales channel) where products are displayed/sold (smart store, shopping window individually). If one smart store, If you are operating two shopping windows, there are a total of three sites, and sales (+ delivery) from each site can only be viewed in the report for that site. UI that allows you to select a site at the top left of BizAdvisor statistics When you click on another site, you can see information about the clicked site. The Smart Store Center [Statistics] menu for mobile devices only shows statistics for one Smart Store site among various sales channels/sites (due to UI limitations). If you need to check information about other sales channels/sites, use the [Statistics] report. When you select one of the options and move to the bottom, you can see a button called [View in new window in BizAdvisor]. (Refer to the leftmost screen among the example screens below) After clicking the button, you can view statistics for that site by clicking > Go and selecting a site as shown in the example screen below. ② The difference between the orders in Smart Store Center [Sales Management] and the BizAdvisor Statistics [Sales Analysis] report is due to the ‘unpaid cancellation’ case. The Smart Store Center [Sales Management > Order Integrated Search] also includes ‘unpaid cancellation’ cases. The BizAdvisor [Sales Analysis > Sales Performance, Product Performance] report only includes orders that have been paid at least once, so ‘cancellation of non-payment’ is not considered. For example, in the Smart Store Center [Sales Management > Order Integrated Search] screen, see the image below. In cases where the order status is the same as in the image, orders with the order status of 'cancelled without payment' are not included in BizAdvisor statistics. ③ When the [statistical data] and [order data] do not appear to match the payment amount data for a specific product. There is no problem with consistency in the overall payment amount, but when looking at individual products, the payment data such as the payment amount may appear to be inconsistent. Statistics In the case of statistical reports that provide information 'by product', such as [Sales Analysis > Product Performance], [Product Category/Product Name/Product ID] are considered together and the data is lumped together, so if [Product Category/Product Name] changes, the data is separated into different rows. For example, if the 'Product Name' is changed from ⓐ to ⓑ for [same product ID] in a specific period, the rows of ⓐ and ⓑ are separated in the table and chart even if the [Product ID] is the same. Because of this, it may be misunderstood that [statistical data] and [order data] do not match. If the payment amount does not match when looking at each product, the product name before and after the product name change for a specific [Product ID] may be misunderstood. Please look at all sales, or sort by product ID in the table to look at data for the same [Product ID]. ④ If you still have doubts about the consistency of sales-related data, use the same method as ① above to sort by sales channel (site After looking into the details (separate), we also checked the 'cancellation of non-payment' case as in ②, but if the consistency is still questionable, you must provide sufficient information so that we can determine the cause.

In what cases does a marketing channel appear as ‘other channels’?,"[Other > Other Channel] is the name of the marketing channel for inflows that do not belong to any other marketing channel category. (Example: When HTTP referrer is IP, URL Scheme is not HTTP or HTTPS, etc.) June 17, 2019 (Mon) ), the inflows were classified as [Other > Other Channels], and those with a clear inflow URL are classified as the newly created [Website > Website] marketing channel after June 18, 2019 (Tuesday). Inflow that does not belong to the [Website > Website] channel will still be shown as [Other > Other Channels]. Example) In the case of inflow from Daum Cafe (http://cafe.daum.net) in 2019. 06. 17. Previously, it was classified as [Other > Other Channels], but in 2019. After 06. 18, it is classified as [Website > Website > cafe.daum.net]. Example) In case of inflow from a specific IP 2019. 06. 17. Previously, it was classified as [Other > Other Channel] and 2019. Even after 06. 18, it will be classified as [Other > Other Channels].

"If it comes directly, how is it categorized by marketing channel?","If the site is accessed by entering the URL directly in the browser address bar or through browser favorites, it is not recognized as a marketing channel and does not appear in the [Marketing Analysis] related data. For example, if all visits yesterday were direct inflows as above, the number of customers, inflows, payments, etc. due to the inflow are not visible in the marketing analysis, so the actual number of visits and the inflow indicators from the marketing analysis may be different.

I want to know the concept of marketing channel performance analysis.,"This help explains the 'Based on last click' and '14-day contribution estimate' areas shown in the bottom table of the [Marketing Analysis] sub-report (all channels, search channels, etc.) of BizAdvisor statistics. In order to attract customers to their sites for sales, sellers operate several marketing channels. Sellers should monitor the performance of marketing channels, continue to strengthen those that are performing well, and improve those that are not performing well. Marketing Channels Reports that show specific performance are [Marketing Analysis] sub-reports, where performance is displayed as the value of [Inflow, Payment, Inflow-Payment Connection (Conversion)]. Customers enter the site (inflow) using various marketing channels. Payment is made, but in this case, it is difficult to know how much the customer was influenced by which marketing channel to make the payment. (In some cases, it is difficult even for the customer who made the payment to know how much was influenced by which marketing channel. Therefore, various methods have been devised to show which marketing channel was influenced by the inflow of a customer when making a payment, and these methods are called 'attribution models' (marketing channel is the payment ( (or conversion) BizAdvisor Statistics provides two 'attribution models', the 'last click' method and the '14-day contribution estimate' method, through which it is possible to determine how much each marketing channel inflow contributed to payment. To help you understand each contribution model, we will explain the following cases as examples. [Last click model] This is the ‘attribution model’ that has traditionally been used for the longest time. It is a method that assumes that ‘the inflow of the marketing channel closest to the payment (conversion) contributed 100%.’ ​​/ Model based on the above example If interpreted as, the closest inflow to the payment on April 14th is Naver Shopping Search on April 14th (5), and this Naver Shopping Search will receive 100 contribution to the payment amount of 100,000 won. (The 'last click model' ', it is judged that there is no contribution from other marketing channels other than (5).) If you search by the viewing period (2022.04.01 ~ 2022.04.14) in [Marketing Analysis > All Channels], the table provided at the bottom of the report shows It looks like this: For reference, in the 'last click' model provided by BizAdvisor statistics, the report is provided by evaluating the inflow closest to the payment as 100% contributed among the inflows that occurred on the 'same day' as the day the payment occurred. .If inflow and payment are made on different dates, [Inflow-Payment] is not connected.Example) If a person made an inflow on 2022.04.01 23:50 and then made a payment on 2022.04.02 01:30 Date of inflow and payment Since the are different, inflow and payment are not connected in the ‘last click’ model. Additionally, according to the 'last click' model, there is no inflow contributing to payment. [14-day contribution estimation model] When a customer makes a payment, there are cases where the payment is greatly influenced by the one marketing channel closest to the payment (attribution model 'last click'), but various marketing channels are used. There may be many cases where a payment is made after being influenced by viewing the content. If a payment is made after inflow using various marketing channels, it is assumed that various marketing channels contributed to the payment, and appropriate measures are taken for the inflow from each marketing channel. There are models that distribute contribution, and BizAdvisor Statistics provides the '14-day contribution estimation model' as a model that reflects this situation. The '14-day contribution estimation model' provided by BizAdvisor Statistics includes the payment date when payment occurs. Therefore, it is a 'contribution model' that believes that the inflow of various marketing channels over the past 14 days contributed to the payment. If the above case is interpreted as this model, from the payment on April 14th, (1) to (5) over the past 14 days There was an influx of marketing channels, and it is believed that all of these marketing channels contributed to the payment. The contribution (degree of contribution) of each marketing channel to the payment is distributed according to logic. In general, the marketing channel with good average performance has a higher Contribution is taken, and the inflow of marketing channels closer to payment takes a higher contribution. In the case above, for example, contribution to payment can be distributed to each marketing channel as follows. (Payment made on April 14th The amount is distributed to marketing channel inflows from April 1 to April 14. Please note that the payment contribution ratio and size of payment amount distributed below are shown as examples, and the actual model/report count will vary.) If you search for the viewing period (2022.04.01 ~ 2022.04.14) after (2022.04.15) in [Marketing Analysis > All Channels], the table provided at the bottom of the report shows the following / Viewing period (2022.04.02 ~ 2022.04) .14), the table provided at the bottom of the report looks as follows. (In the table above, [Naver Guaranteed Display Ads] introduced on 2022.04.01 is excluded) If you search by day (2022.04.14), The table provided at the bottom of the report looks as follows. (In the table above, [Naver site search ads] came in from 2022.04.02 to 2022.04.13. [Naver Performance Display Advertising] is excluded, and only information on inflows that occurred during the day of 2022.04.14 is provided) - The payment amount value for payment (+14 days contribution estimate) varies depending on the time of inquiry during a certain period of time. (It is updated for 14 days.) In the above example, if you view the report on April 1st on April 2nd, no payment has occurred yet, so the table under the [Marketing Analysis > All Channels] report looks as follows. However, if you view the 4/1 report on 4/15, the contribution to the payment that occurred on 4/14 has been distributed to the inflow on 4/1, so it looks like this. Payment information in the Payment (+14-day contribution estimate) section is affected and updated by payments that occurred over the next 14 days, including the day the inflow occurred. (Payments exceeding 14 days are not affected.) ※ reference. After February 24, 2022, marketing channels related to [tools used for convenient shopping] will not receive [(payment) contribution] even if there is an inflow, as it is difficult to say that they contributed to the payment generation. (Regardless of the type of contribution model) Marketing channels that do not receive (payment) contributions are as follows.

(3) If 'No search term' appears in Google search or Bing search. If the entry is made to the site through Google search, Bing search, etc., the inflow site may know that the entry came from the relevant search service.

Appears to be increasing - If you go back and reconnect using the terminal's Back function (browser return, smartphone Back button), the page is loaded with a parameter that can track the advertisement, so there is no click on the advertisement, but there is an influx. appears to be increasing 2) When the number of inflows (than the actual number of click actions) appears to be low - When the landing page size is very large (several tens of megabytes) and the page takes a long time to load, and the user leaves the page after clicking the return button before loading is completed Script The number of inflows may decrease because logs cannot be delivered because the script is not loaded, and if you click the browser's stop loading button while the page is loading, the number of inflows may also decrease because the logs cannot be delivered because the script is not loaded. - Advertisement through redirection Example of a case where the parameter measured due to inflow disappears) After clicking on an advertisement, it goes through another log collection server and then lands on the advertisement page. If the parameters are not passed directly from the collection server, the parameters may disappear - Advertising platform Example) When stopping the generation of parameters in Naver Search Advertising, turning the 'Automatic Tracking URL Parameter' function setting for each campaign ON and then OFF ※ Note. Naver Performance Display Advertising (GFA) does not have a tracking function turned off. - If the page stops loading due to a terminal problem, the script does not work and logs are not transmitted to Naver Analytics, so inflow counts cannot be made. Example 1) Specific Case where the mobile phone network is temporarily interrupted after landing on the page Example 2) When the page is interrupted due to subway movement, etc. while loading the page after clicking on an advertisement - Case where part of the advertisement Link_URL goes to a site other than the site being measured Example) The advertisement Link_URL Most of them are smart stores, but if some of them are their own malls, the number of clicks measured on a smart store site basis by the advertising platform is high, but the number of inflows measured by the smart store may be much lower than the number of advertisement clicks. [Exception] Smart stores/brand stores There is no problem, but the number of inflows from non-Smart Store sites appears to be lower (than the actual number of click actions) - If the script is not properly installed on the landing page, the inflow is lost due to the script not sending logs, so the inflow is greater than the number of clicks. Appears written - When the page for a PC device is redirected after accessing the URL of a page for a PC device with a mobile device, the URL parameter disappears and tracking becomes impossible, so the number of inflows cannot be counted even if logs are sent to Naver Analytics※ Note. · Advertisement for mobile devices When executing, it is recommended to use the Smart Store mobile URL. · If the access page size is tens of megabytes, the inflow may not be counted, so it is recommended to keep the product detail page size large. · After clicking the ad, go to the site. Please check that the advertising parameters are not lost during redirection. (No problem for smart stores and brand stores)

Marketing Analytics Frequently Asked Questions,"Q1) There is an unknown URL in ‘Channel Details’ in [Marketing Analysis > Website Channel]. What service is it? (a) In case of inflow from friens.naver.com (if friens.naver.com is in the channel details) Click [Gift > Gift to a Friend] on the product detail page for mobile devices in Smart Store And, if you access the product detail page by clicking the It is classified as [.naver.com]. In this case, the table at the bottom of the statistical [Marketing Analysis > Website Channel] report is displayed as shown below. (b) campaign.naver.com This is a site to be used as a temporary promotional page for various services of Naver and is used for various purposes in various services. For example, there may be the following: 'https://campaign.' naver.com/event/npay-travelnloca 2208'(c) link.naver.com When Naver services, etc. create a 'shortened link' to the relevant content or page, reach the site through [link.naver.com] Therefore, from the site's perspective, it is often measured as coming from [link.naver.com]. For example, if you create a shortened URL like the one below, it will be seen from the site's perspective as entering the site from link.naver.com.'https: //naver.me/5xN49rot'(d) keep.naver.com This is Naver's keep service. (e) *.navercorp.comOOO If the inflow is from Navercorp.com, it is Naver's internal system for Naver service management. For example, there are the following cases: - pmon.navercorp.com, pmon2.navercorp.com: Monitoring system for Naver Shopping service quality management (f) ad-creative.gfa.naver.com Performance display If the advertisement flows into the Smart Store/Brand Store/Shopping Window site by clicking on the advertisement of [Catalog Sales Campaign], it is not caught as [Advertisement > Naver Performance Display Advertisement] but flows from the ad-creative.gfa.naver.com domain. (g) kin.naver.com, m.kin.naver.com If store inflow occurs from Naver intellectual service, it is classified as kin.naver.com or m.kin.naver.com.Other Naver Please understand that we cannot respond to inflows from sources other than the service, as it is difficult to separately identify them. Q2) Inflows from Naver search advertisements, brand searches, etc. are not detected. (Or the search term is not captured.) A) If you are using Naver advertising, you must select the automatic tracking URL function for each campaign at [https://searchad.naver.com/] to ensure inflow from Naver search advertising and Naver brand search. This is captured normally. If you are using a search-type display advertisement among Naver display advertisements, if you enter the URL parameter of [n_query={query}] in the link_url of the advertisement, the {query} part will be replaced with [search term] when the advertisement is clicked and will be entered into the site. Using this, search terms can be displayed in the report.※ Note. For more specific settings, please contact Display Advertising. Q3) Can one specific inflow be divided into multiple inflows? A) One specific inflow can only be captured through one marketing channel, and the number of inflows is measured only once. .※ reference. It is not divided into two or more marketing channels or one inflow is not measured twice. Q4) Is it possible to track inflow and conversion even if the landing is to a place other than the product detail page, such as product category or shopping story? A) Product detail page In addition, if it lands anywhere inside the store, such as a product category or shopping story, it is considered an 'inflow', and once the inflow is measured, conversion can be tracked/measured. Q5) When measuring inflow, additions such as that the residence time must be over a certain amount of time are added. Are there any conditions? A) There are none. As long as you access the store from outside the store, inflow is measured based on those conditions, and there are no additional conditions (e.g. residence time, etc.) to measure inflow. ※ Note. However, if you enter the URL directly on the site and access it, it is not measured as inflow, nor is it measured in the number of customers. Q6) Inflow is coming from advertisements that are not executed or have been executed. - The advertisement was executed only on mobile devices. , PC inflow has occurred. A) For various reasons, a situation like the question may occur, or it may be misunderstood as a question-like situation. As various cases can occur, we have listed the possible situations below for your reference. (a) When an advertisement for the same site is executed from another advertising account When measuring inflow in Smart Store Center [Statistics], the person viewing the report We do not check whether the person executing the ad matches. Even if an ad is executed from another ad account, the number of inflows is measured if the ad is accessed to my site. (b) If it is your account, but the ad is being executed by another ad group. , or if you misunderstand the conditions of advertisement exposure time, etc. The internal structure of the advertisement being used is complex (e.g., Naver search advertisements have a structure of campaign > ad group > material, keyword, etc.) or the ad group being executed is complex. Because there are so many, you may misunderstand that the advertisement has been stopped when in fact the advertisement is running. Or, you may be able to set the advertisement exposure time, but you may misunderstand the conditions for the advertisement exposure time. (c) While the advertisement is open, If you click on the ad later, even if the ad remains open in the browser and is clicked later after the ad execution end time has passed, it may be caught as an inflow of the ad. (d) After clicking on the ad, the URL of the landing page is kept as is. In case of re-entering, even if you click on the ad and keep the URL of the landing page and then re-enter (e.g., entering through favorites or clicking on a URL shared in a messenger chat room, etc.), it is also measured as inflow. (e) If you misunderstand by looking at the statistical (BizAdvisor) report, see information such as [nt_source=naver.gfa] in the [Statistics > Marketing Analysis > Custom Channel] report and in GFA (Naver Performance Display Advertising). There are many cases where there is a misunderstanding that an inflow has occurred. [Naver Performance Display Advertising] is a marketing channel that ignores even if the inflow is customized using the nt_OOO parameter, so the [GFA inflow] information shown in the user-defined channel is the actual GFA inflow. This is not the case. Some people misunderstand when they see [Naver Performance Display Ads] that appears in the [Sales Analysis > Product/Marketing Channel] report. For example, I am looking at a report for 7/27, and this report says [Naver Performance] This is a case where it is thought that [Naver Performance Display Ad] that was not executed on July 27 appears to have flowed in just because [Physical Display Ad] was displayed. The [Sales Analysis > Product/Marketing Channel] report provides information based on the payment date. Since marketing channels and connections report inflows and distribute payment information (number of payments, payment amount) for the past 14 days, including the payment date, advertisements that were not executed on 7/27 may also be displayed in this report. (f) In cases where an advertisement for mobile devices was executed but PC inflow was detected. Inquiries may be received because an advertisement displayed on a mobile device page was executed but an inflow with [Channel Attribute] was (PC) occurred. Currently, [Channel] In [Properties], the browser information of the terminal used by the customer is checked and displayed on PC/mobile. If the customer accesses the mobile page using a PC and clicks on the advertisement, [Channel Properties] is displayed as “PC”. Q7) Specific There is no inflow from marketing means. What should I do?A) If the landing of the advertisement/marketing tool is not a smart store/brand store/shopping window. If the landing of the advertisement introduction is a shopping live or a landing in a place other than a smart store/brand store/shopping window, such as a special exhibition. BizAdvisor statistics are not provided. Please check whether the advertising creative landing is somewhere other than Smart Store/Brand Store/Shopping Window. Q8) Even if the product at the time of inflow and the product paid for do not match, are the inflow and payment connected? ?A) After payment has occurred, when assigning the payment amount that contributed to the inflow to the marketing channel, the person who brought in and the person who made the payment are found to be the same and connect the inflow and payment, so even if the product and payment product are different when the product is landed at the time of inflow, the person If the details are the same, inflow and payment (conversion) are connected.※ Note. The contents apply equally to all inflow/marketing channel types, and the same applies to user-defined (nt_OOO). Q9) I would like to measure inflow from smartphone applications. A) Smartphone app (app) ) can be measured using [(inflow) user-defined (nt_OOO)]. For more detailed information, please refer to the help below. Custom Inflow Concepts and Methods Go to Help»Q10) The number of visitors to the Smart Store home and the number of visitors (=number of customers) in statistics are different. A) The values ​​of the above two pieces of information are often different due to the different logic for calculating the values. The information displayed on the Smart Store home is [total number of visitors], which is the sum of [today's number of visitors] and the number of daily visitors. (It is not the number of visits, but the number of people who visit. One visitor can generate multiple visits.)※ Note. On the mobile smart store screen, it is displayed as 'Number of visits: 152', but it is 'Number of visitors', not the number of visits. If you compare the [Number of today's visitors] displayed on the smart store with the value of statistics (BizAdvisor), [Statistics > Marketing analysis > It should be compared with the [Number of customers] of [All channels].■ Number of Smart Store Home Today visitors - (a) Number of user identifiers of people who accessed the site (smart store) with duplicates removed by day - (b) Number of users outside the site Measuring both people who entered through links and people who visited the site directly■ Statistics (BizAdvisor) Number of customers - (c) Number of daily duplicates removed from the user identifiers of people who accessed the site - (d) In case of entering through links outside the site It is only measured, and people who directly visit the site are excluded from the measurement. In addition, the standards for (a) and (c) are also different if you go into detail. The two indicators above (number of visitors today vs. number of customers) have very different measurement standards, so they are not directly measured. There is no particular analytical meaning in comparing. If you want to continuously monitor the number of visitors or customer indicators, we recommend that you continuously monitor [Statistics (BizAdvisor) Number of Customers]. ※ Reference. July 10, 2023 (Mon.) ) Filtering logic has been applied to the inflow shown in the statistics. View related notices » If you are viewing a report after the above filtering application date in the report available in the 'Statistics' menu of the Smart Store Center [Number of inflows/Number of customers] Abnormal inflow has been removed, and the value has been reduced to a certain extent when compared to the value of the report on the date before filtering was applied. Accordingly, the difference between [Number of Smart Store Home Visits] and [Number of Inflows/Number of Customers] in 'Statistics' has become larger. Please note that this is happening a lot. If you would like to continuously monitor the [number of customers/visits] indicator, please monitor the [number of customers] that can be viewed in the 'Statistics' menu of the Smart Store Center. Q11) Naver Talk Talk marketing message Although it has never been sent, there is an influx of Naver TalkTalk. A) In addition to marketing messages, all cases of accessing the smart store/shopping window through the Naver TalkTalk service are counted as 'Naver TalkTalk inflow'. For example, if you click on a link to the product detail page while having a conversation through TalkTalk inquiry on the product detail page, it will be counted as 'Naver TalkTalk' inflow. Q12) Can I also know the payment history through Shopping Story? A ) Shopping Story is inside the store, and please understand that information about movement flow and payment inside the store is not yet provided. Q13) How is the inflow captured at the time of payment after landing from Shopping Story on Instagram? A ) Shopping Story is an area within the Smart Store, and inflow is measured when accessing the store from outside the store. In this case, accessing Shopping Story from Instagram is when accessing the store from outside the store, so go to [Social > Instagram] The inflow is captured. Q14) When the inflow is made by clicking on a link in a KakaoTalk message to the Smart Store and then making a payment, what is the inflow channel measured by? A) The inflow from KakaoTalk is currently not captured as any inflow. KakaoTalk inflow If you want to measure (inflow), you must use the user-defined channel method. Please refer to the help below for how to use it. Go to the help on the concept and method of user-defined inflow » Q15) Looking at [Summary > Real-time report, Today's report], I found something strange. Many inflows are confirmed. It appears that someone is causing the inflow maliciously. Is it possible to check if anything is having a negative impact on the store and what the cause is? A) BizAdvisor statistics only observe/measure the situation and show it, but it appears that the situation is malicious. It is difficult to know whether it is or whether it has an effect on the store. It is realistically difficult to determine the cause, and please understand that we are unable to provide guidance due to low accuracy. Q16) There is an influx of search terms that are completely unrelated to the store's products. A) When matching products with search terms entered by users in the search system, a wide variety of information elements about the product are considered from the product perspective. In this process, part of the search term and very partial elements of product information are considered. There are cases where they are matched. Even if the search term and the product are not directly related, please note that part of the search term or part of the product information may be matched. Q17) Do you know the performance of each material in guaranteed/performance display advertising? A) Currently, there is no way to know the performance of each material through BizAdvisor statistics. Even if you customize (nt_OOO), Naver advertising-related marketing channels ignore it, so there is a way to know the performance of each material through BizAdvisor statistics. Please understand that this is not available. Q18) I accessed the Smart Store site, but it does not seem to be detected as an inflow. Why is this?A) BizAdvisor statistics do not measure direct inflow to the site (technically, if there is no referrer when entering the site). Direct inflow to the site (if there is no referrer) can occur in the following cases:- When entering the site by directly typing the site URL into the browser - When entering the site through browser favorites - When entering the site through a QR code - When entering the site by clicking on a smartphone app (e.g. KakaoTalk) link Smartphone app When entering a site by clicking a link, it is generally a case of direct inflow to the site, so inflow cannot be measured. In this case, you can measure inflow by setting [User-defined inflow]. (Please refer to the related help.) Even when entering the site through a QR code, inflow measurement may not be possible. If you set [Custom Inflow] to the Link_URL connected to the QR code, you can also measure inflow. Q19) In the table of the marketing analysis report, [PC/Mobile] is displayed in the [Channel Properties] column. What standard is this information based on? Is it displayed as ?A) There is a [Channel Properties] column in the table of the Smart Store Center [Statistics > Marketing Analysis] sub-report, where one of the two values ​​[PC/Mobile] is entered. This information is This means [type of single-shot period] when the inflow occurs. (It does not refer to the type of web page used by the terminal.) For example, if the inflow was into the store through [media for mobile devices] using a terminal called 'PC', the [channel properties] of the inflow are those of the connecting terminal. It is classified as 'PC' based on the type of product, and if it flows into the store through [Media for PC] using a [smart phone], the [Channel Attribute] of the inflow is classified as [Mobile], which is the type of access terminal. .Q20) In [Summary > Real-time Report], there are cases where the ‘number of visitors’ is greater than the ‘number of inflows’. Why is that so? A) In [Summary > Real-time Report], the 'number of visiting customers' considers the number of customers who have inflowed in the last 30 minutes or the number of customers who have been active within the site for 30 minutes without inflow, whereas the number of inflows must be reported through external media. Since only incoming cases are counted, the 'number of visitors' may be greater than the 'number of inflows'. For example, if three specific people are continuously browsing the site for more than an hour and there is no inflow of other people, the number of visitors is There are 3 people, but the report shows that the inflow is 0.

Custom Inflow Frequently Asked Questions,"Q1) When there is a link URL to the smart store, how to create a URL to customize the inflow (nt_OOO). A) You must attach the nt_OOO parameter and value to Link_URL. (At least 2 parameters: nt_source=OOO, nt_medium=OOO) and value must be present. If even these two are not present, it is judged to be an incorrect inflow customization, and the nt_OOO customization setting is ignored.) Example 1) When customizing the Link_URL to the smart store product detail page (original link_url) https://smartstore.naver.com/allchir/products/7235299848 (custom link_url) https://smartstore.naver.com/allchir/products/7235299848?nt_source=kakaotalk&nt_medium=messenger&nt_datail=April subscription campaign - Basic structure: (Existing link_url) + [?a=1&b=2&c=3] format - Since ? must appear only once in the entire URL, if ? is already in the existing URL, attach it as [&a=1&b=2&c=3] Example 2 ) When customizing the Link_URL to the brand store shopping story (if the URL already has ?) (original link_url) https://brand.naver.com/OOOOO/shoppingstory/detail?id=2001969613&page1 (custom link_url ) https://brand.naver.com/OOOOO/shoppingstory/detail?id=2001969613&page1&nt_source=kakaotalk&nt_medium=messenger&nt_datail=April subscription campaign - ? must appear only once in the entire link_url. Incorrect example) If ? is entered twice in the entire URL ( detail?id=, /?nt_source)https://brand.naver.com/OOOOO/shoppingstory/detail?id=2001990823/?nt_source=navet_specialDA&nt_medium=naver&nt_datai=0524EC - This is an incorrect URL format because another ? appears after ?. Special symbols such as / must not appear after the ? that appears first on the left (must only appear in this format: ?a=1&b=2&c=3)→ Correctly modified URL) https://brand.naver.com/OOOOO/shoppingstory/detail ?id=2001990823&nt_source=navet_specialDA&nt_medium=naver&nt_datai=0524EC※ Note.· When customizing the inflow, each nt_OOO parameter and value are entered in the form of [nt_OOO=value]. There must be at least two parameters: nt_source=OOO, nt_medium=OOO and a value pair. If these two (nt_source, nt_medium) are not present, it is judged to be an incorrect inflow customization and the nt_OOO customization setting is ignored. There are three special characters that can be used in values: hyphen (-), underscore (_), and period (.). nt_source and nt_medium are available only in English and the above special symbols, and nt_datail and nt_keyword are available only in English, Korean and the above special symbols. (We recommend not using Korean if possible.) Q2) Check whether the URL created for customization fits the link_url format and test whether it actually flows in. A) When creating the URL for customization manually, the URL is a URL used on the Internet. In many cases, it does not fit the format. It is recommended to check and test whether the format is correct before actual application. When you search in a search engine using the search terms [url parser], [url parameter formatter], etc., sites containing contents such as URL Parser and Query String Splitter are confirmed in the search results. , If you insert the link_url you created yourself into the relevant sites, you can check whether the link_url was created well without errors in terms of format. For example, if you search with url parameter formatter in an English search engine, you can use the site below that is displayed to check if the link_URL is formatted in terms of format. Let's check if it was created without errors at - https://www.freefomatter.com/url-parser-query-string-splitter.html(a) Check if it matches the format① https://www.freefomatter.com/ Access url-parser-query-string-splitter.html ② Enter the URL created for inflow customization in the UI below and click the Parser URL ③ Check whether all nt_OOOs set such as nt_source, nt_medium, nt_datail, etc. are visible on the left, and check the number given for each nt_OOO. Please check that the values ​​appear correctly on the right. If these values ​​look like below, the URL format is normal. If the URL format is incorrect) ​If you check the example URL used in ‘incorrect example’ in Q1) above, it is as follows: https://brand.naver.com/OOOOO/shoppingstory/detail?id=2001990823/?nt_source=navet_specialDA&nt_medium =naver&nt_datai=0524EC As shown in the image below, nt_source is visible on the right side of the ID, and nt_source is not visible on the left column, so this case is not normal. ※ Note. The above tool is a tool that helps you check whether the URL form is normal, but it is not a tool that necessarily guarantees that it is normal. (b) Test whether the inflow is coming in using BizAdvisor statistics. If the previously created URL is normal, [Summary > Real-time report] In the Top 10 inflows by marketing channel, you can check the inflow within 1 to 3 minutes after it actually occurs under the marketing channel name 'Custom'. (It is not possible to check in real time for each nt_OOO parameter value) You can check for each nt_OOO in the [Marketing Analysis > Custom Channel] report created the day after the actual occurrence. Q3) If the URL format is normal, but is not confirmed in [Summary > Real-time Report] or [Marketing Analysis > Custom Channel] (a) The URL format is normal, but is not confirmed in [Summary > Real-time Report] or [Marketing Analysis] > If it is not confirmed in [Custom Channel], it appears to be a Naver advertising-related marketing channel that ignores customization. Please check whether [Customization] has been done for the following advertising products. - Customization inflow is not applied. There are a total of 12 marketing channels that are not applied (or ignored even if applied): [Naver Click Choice Plus], [Naver Click Choice Plus Product Advertisement], [Naver Shopping Search Advertisement], and [Naver Site Search] in [Search Advertisement] Advertisement], [Naver Brand Search (General Type)], [Naver Brand Search (Brand Zone Type)], [Naver New Product Search], [Naver Search View], [Naver Place Advertisement] 9 types, [Naver Performance Type] of [Advertisement] Display Advertisement], 2 types of [Naver Guaranteed Display Advertisement], 1 type of [Naver Shopping-Advertisement] of [Shopping], 12 types in total (b) The wrong site may be selected in BizAdvisor statistics. BizAdvisor statistics may be site/sales Reports are provided on a per-channel basis. (If you are operating one smart store and two shopping windows, reports are provided for a total of three sites.) Please check whether the correct site/sales channel is selected. Q4) Use the nt_OOO parameter to land on Shopping Live. I customized it, but the information is not visible in BizAdvisor statistics. A) There are two sites where BizAdvisor statistics capture inflow: 'Smart Store' and 'Shopping Window'. For Shopping Live, please check Shopping Live statistics. Q5) Can I use a shortened URL to set up a custom channel? A) It may or may not work depending on the setting method. Please note that there are two major cases below. ① It is generally possible to include the entire nt_OOO parameter and value in the shortened URL. Example) Landing page URL: https://smartstore.naver.com/allchir/products/7235299848nt_OOO Combining parameters: https://smartstore.naver.com/allchir/products/7235299848?nt_source=naversearchad&nt_medium=searchad&nt_detail=newcampaign If you make this entire URL into a short URL and use it as a Link (example: http://bit.y/3OfPea (Use as a link) It is possible to check the inflow of a user-defined channel. ② Please consider not adding the nt_OOO parameter to the end of a shortened URL because the corresponding nt_OOO parameters are generally not delivered in many cases. Q6) Within the Smart Store/Brand Store Even if I customize Shopping Story (nt_OOO), will it be counted as inflow, payment conversion, etc.? A) Shopping Story is an internal page of Smart Store. Therefore, when landing on Shopping Story, it is counted as inflow, and when payment occurs, payment conversion is also counted. Since a user-defined inflow (nt_OOO) is also a type of inflow, it is treated the same as other inflows. (Inflow measurement and payment conversion are also captured.) Q7) When setting custom (nt_OOO) to the URL, do I need to set the URL separately for PC site URL and mobile site URL? A) No. If you set either the PC site URL or the mobile site URL, the other site will work well. For example, https://brand.naver.com/OOOOO/shoppingstory/detail?id=2001990823&nt_source=naver_specialDA&nt_medium=displayad The above URL is a site URL for PC devices, but even if you access the above URL using a mobile device, the nt_OOO parameter is normally displayed. collected https://m.brand.naver.com/OOOOO/shoppingstory/detail?id=2001990823&nt_source=naver_specialDA&nt_medium=displayad The above URL is a site URL for mobile devices, but even if you access the above URL using a PC device, nt_OOO Parameters are collectedQ8) When measuring the performance of display advertising, is there a way to measure it for each material? A) Currently, there is no way to measure the performance of display advertising for each material. Even if you customize (nt_OOO), display advertising is a marketing channel that ignores customization (nt_OOO), so measurement is not possible even if you customize. Q9) Even if you customize (nt_OOO), the setting is of no use. Can you tell me the specific meaning and what marketing channels there are? A) When customizing (nt_OOO), there are cases where there is a variety of information that can be classified as an inflow from a specific inflow that occurs. Information for inflow classification Since there are many types, they can be classified as either A or B. For this reason, priority is given to information that considers various inflow classifications, and high-priority information is used to consistently distribute information through specific marketing channels. The logic is designed to classify. Most marketing channels are designed so that customization (nt_OOO) has a high priority, so when inflow occurs, information can be viewed in [Marketing Analysis > Custom Channel]. However, among all marketing channels, some marketing channels have higher priority than customization (nt_OOO) because the information for classifying them as the relevant marketing channel is higher, so customization (nt_OOO) has no effect. For example, [Naver site search advertisement] In the case of ], even if you customize (nt_OOO) (if the automatic tracking URL parameter function is set in the advertisement or if you are using premium log analysis), the customization (nt_OOO) does not play any role and only [Naver Site Search Ad] is classified. . (It is not classified as customization.) Please note that the marketing channels in which customization (mt_OOO) does not play any role are as follows.

Q9) I customized (nt_OOO) for an advertising product (e.g. Naver Guaranteed/Performance Display Advertising) that ignores customization, but the inflow is detected. Why is this?A) There may be two cases as follows.Case 1) In the case of Naver guaranteed/performance display advertising, customization (nt_OOO) is ignored. However, inflow often occurs from other inflow methods. However, since values ​​such as [naver_special_da] are shown in the nt_OOO value of the [Marketing Analysis > Custom Channel] report, there are cases where this is misunderstood to mean that the inflow occurred from [Naver Guaranteed Display Advertisement], etc. [Marketing Analysis > Custom Channel] ] Even if you see a value like nt_source=naver_special_da in the report, this inflow came from somewhere other than Naver guaranteed/performance display advertising. If you use this nt_OOO value in another type of inflow method, Case 2) In the case of Naver search advertising products, if you do not set an automatic tracking URL for each campaign and do not use premium log analysis, if you set custom (nt_OOO) in link_URL, it can be classified as custom. (In this case, the actual Naver search ad inflow is classified as custom, so you can check the details in the [Marketing Analysis > Custom Channel] report.)

Marketing Channel Performance Analysis Concept Frequently Asked Questions,"Q1) If I purchase a product other than the product on the page that landed after inflow, or if I make a purchase a few hours after leaving the site, will the payment amount (contributed) be captured? A) If I purchase a product other than the product on the page that landed after inflow, Or, even if you make a purchase a few hours after leaving the site, the payment (conversion) amount is calculated as the amount of the actual product purchased. Depending on the time difference between the inflow and payment and the method of dividing the payment amount between the inflows, the following two values ​​are provided: - For payments (based on last click) If the inflow and payment are on the same date (e.g. 10:00 AM) Inflow, payment at 5 PM) Regardless of actions taken in the middle, the inflow closest to the payment receives 100% of the payment contribution amount. If the inflow and payment date are different, the payment and inflow are not connected. - In the case of payment (+14 days contribution estimate), the inflow and the actually paid product are connected, and it does not matter if any action other than the inflow occurs between the inflow and payment. What is different from payment (based on the last click) is that the inflow and the actual purchased product are connected. The only difference is that the contribution to the payment is distributed to the inflow that occurred. Q2) If the advertisement lands in a place other than a smart store, brand store, or shopping window, and a purchase (payment) is made by accessing the smart store afterwards, does the first advertisement receive payment contribution? A) Marketing in smart store statistics Effort is only measured as 'inflow' of people entering your site. For example, in the case of [(a) Search advertisement (click) > (b) Shopping promotion (click) > (c) Smart Store product details & payment] (c) When looking for the inflow of marketing channels that contributed to payment, go directly to the site. Only the inflow (b) is considered, and the marketing effort (a), which is not a site inflow, is unknown data from a statistical standpoint, so it cannot be a contributing marketing channel. Q3) After inflow from a marketing channel, several (A, B, C) ) What happens if you purchase a product? A) Whenever a specific payment occurs, the contribution is distributed according to the attribution model (e.g. last click, 14-day contribution estimate, etc.) to the marketing channel inflow that occurred before it. Each payment is unaffected by other payments. If payments are made to A, B, and C after marketing channel inflow (Z), payment A is distributed to Z, and payment C is also distributed to Z. Q4) In the table at the bottom of the [Marketing Analysis > All Channels] report, select [Payment (+ In the [14-day contribution estimate] section, the number of payments is 0, but there are cases where there is a small amount of payment. Why is this? A) For example, the table at the bottom of the [Marketing Analysis > All Channels] report may contain the following cases. In this case, when looking at the payment (+14-day contribution estimate) model, the actual number of payments is very small. The number of payments has a value of 0.0x, so the number of payments is so small that it cannot be displayed on the screen (0.02), but the payment amount is an integer. Since it is possible to express it, it is a case where a small payment amount appears. Q5) The number of orders/product orders (payment amount) shown in Smart Store Center [Sales Management], etc. and [Marketing Analysis > All Channels], [Sales Analysis] > The number of payments (payment amount) shown in [Product/Marketing Channel] is different. A) There is a reason for the difference between the sales/payment information in Smart Store Center [Sales Management] and the payment amount in BizAdvisor statistics. ( a) There is a difference in definition between the number of orders/product orders shown in Smart Store Center [Sales Management], etc., and the number of payments in BizAdvisor statistics. The number of payments shown in BizAdvisor statistics is the number of orders (measured by the number of order numbers). ] or [Number of product orders] (measured by the number of product order numbers). Please refer to the help below for a detailed definition of [Number of payments] provided by BizAdvisor statistics. I would like to know the standards for counting the number of payments. Go to Help»(b) The information shown is different based on the period (date) shown for each report. Each report has different standards for indicators shown for the [selected period]. For reports under [Marketing Analysis], when you select a period, [ It shows information about cases where [Inflow Time] is in the relevant period. Reports under [Sales Analysis] show information about cases where [Payment Time] is within that period when you select a period. This causes misunderstanding. There are cases, for example, while looking at the [Marketing Analysis > All Channels] report, the number of payments in [Payments (+14 days contribution estimate)] on 11/5 is 3, but the actual number of orders that occurred on 11/5 is 1. Subsequently, there may be times when you think that there is an error in the BizAdvisor statistical values. [Marketing Analysis > All Channels] If you select the day '11/5th' in the report, the report will show information about the inflow that occurred on 11/5th. It shows, in the [Payment (+14 days contribution estimate)] section of the table below, how much the inflow on 11/5 contributed to the payments that occurred from [11/5 to 11/18] [number of payments/payment amount] ], etc. (Here, [Payment Amount] is not the total amount paid on that date, but is the [Contribution Distribution Amount] for payments that occurred from '11/5 to 11/18' (total 14 days) . You must see the [Sales Analysis > Sales Performance, Product Performance] report for the total amount paid on that date.) (c) Information on all payments is available in the number of orders/product orders, etc. in Smart Store Center [Sales Management]. However, in [Marketing Analysis > All Channels] of BizAdvisor statistics, only payments related to marketing are shown. In [Payment (based on last click)] in the bottom table of [Marketing Analysis > All Channels] of BizAdvisor statistics, the same day as the inflow date. Information about payments made is shown. However, in [Marketing Analysis > All Channels], only payments related to the marketing channel are shown. (If you go to the shopping cart and pay for a product that was previously placed in the shopping cart, the inflow Because it does not exist, it does not appear in [Marketing Analysis > All Channels]. If you used a marketing channel when putting the product in your shopping cart, and it was within the past 14 days from the time of payment, the payment contribution amount may appear in the [Payment (+14 days contribution estimate)] section.) On the other hand, Smart The number of orders/product orders (payment amount) in Store Center [Sales Management] shows all order/payment information that occurred regardless of marketing channel relevance. Due to this difference in standards, the payment information displayed in Smart Store Center [Sales Management] There will be a difference between the payment information shown in BizAdvisor statistics.

In this help, you may inquire whether there is a problem with the report. We will explain the content related to the inquiry that the 'payment amount' is different depending on the case. Each report in BizAdvisor statistics provides a report based on the time when the following events/actions occurred in the [selected period]. - Sales analysis: Time of payment Standard - Marketing analysis: Based on the time of inflow - Shopping behavior analysis: Based on the time when product detail inquiry/page view occurred The indicator standards shown in the 'selected period' under [Sales Analysis] and under [Marketing Analysis] are different as above. The 'payment amount' information varies depending on the report. To help you understand more specifically, we will explain the following case as an example. (A) Inflow and payment situation (B) The extent to which the inflow contributed to payment (14-day contribution) Estimation) Example of estimation using a contribution model 1. Method shown in reports under sales analysis Reports under sales analysis provide information based on [time of payment] and show all payment amounts incurred during the period. ( Regardless of whether the marketing channel is connected, all payment amounts are included in the total payment amount, and the 'total payment amount' in the reports under sales analysis are all the same) [Sales Analysis > Product/Marketing Channel] report also has the same [Payment time] Information is provided based on ], and it shows whether the payment that occurred during the [viewed period] was caused by the contribution of any past marketing channel before payment. (Report that focuses on payment and shows the contribution of each marketing channel) ※ Reference. It is difficult to determine information related to 'inflow time' in the sales analysis sub-report. In the case above, 1 payment occurred on 4/14, amounting to 100,000 won, so the report is provided as follows. [Sales Analysis > Sales 'Table' in [Performance] (simply summarizes the situation that occurred in (A) above, based on the date the payment occurred) Report viewing period: 2022.04.01 ~ 2022.04.14 (The payment date is April 14th, so any information including that date Even if you select a date, it is displayed as shown below) 'Table' in [Sales Analysis > Product/Marketing Channel] The purpose of this report is to show which marketing channel's contribution contributed to the 'payment' that occurred in the selected period. .

(One payment occurred on 4/14, and that payment was influenced by the marketing channel for the past 14 days. In this report, if you select a period, the number of payments made Since only the perspective is considered and the incoming perspective is not considered, [Sales Analysis > Product/Marketing Channel] looks the same as the table above.)2. How it is displayed in reports under Marketing Analysis [Marketing Analysis] Reports under Marketing Analysis are reports whose purpose is to show the payment performance of the 'inflow' that occurred in the selected period. (Payment information paid without inflow does not appear) To the site Information is provided based on the [inflow time], and this report shows how much the [inflow] that occurred during the [selected period] contributed to the [payment] that occurred thereafter by the 'inflow time'. (Marketing analysis sub-report) It is difficult to determine information related to 'payment time'.) In the case above, the report inquiry period is: 2022.04.01 ~ 2022.04.14. If the inquiry was made on 2022.04.15, the table shows as follows. If you select only [2022.04.01] as the report viewing period and view it on April 15th, it will be displayed as follows. The inflow that occurred in the above selected period [2022.04.01] was only one [Naver Guaranteed Display Advertisement], and this inflow did not contribute to the payment in terms of the contribution model [Payment (based on last click)], and [Payment (+14 days) When looking at the contribution estimate), the report shows that 3%, or 030,000 won (3,000 won), was contributed for the 100,000 won paid on [2022.04.14], which is 3% of payment contribution.

Difference between advertising platform payment amount and BizAdvisor statistics payment amount and related FAQ,"There are frequent inquiries about the difference between the payment amount (conversion sales amount) shown in the conversion analysis service of advertising platforms (Naver Search Ads, Naver Performance Display Ads) and the payment amount in BizAdvisor statistics, so this help is intended to explain this. There is bound to be a difference between the [payment amount] (= conversion sales amount) shown in the conversion analysis service of [advertising platform] and the [payment amount] shown in [BizAdvisor statistics]. To help you understand, the following examples are provided. Let me explain with an example. 1) Payment amount in BizAdvisor statistics [Marketing Analysis > All Channels] (This help explains only the payment amount in [Marketing Analysis > All Channels] among the various payment amounts shown in BizAdvisor statistics. Various payment amounts shown in BizAdvisor Please refer to the help below for information.) ​Why the payment amount for sales analysis is different from the payment amount for marketing analysis Go to help≫ BizAdvisor statistics are a type of site analytics statistics used to promote the site. All marketing channels] and their conversion information are comprehensively provided. (On the other hand, the conversion analysis of the advertising platform only provides conversion analysis information about clicks/inflows that occurred from the advertising platform's perspective.) In the case above, BizAdvisor Provides information on all inflows from [April 1 to April 14], and when a payment occurs, it considers all marketing channels to be related to the payment and provides a report. For example, BizAdvisor Statistics [Marketing] In [Analysis > All Channels], if you search from 2022.04.01 to 2022.04.14, information is displayed as follows. (Information on inflow and conversion for all marketing channels where inflow occurred is shown.) Additionally, BizAdvisor statistics In [Marketing Analysis > All Channels], information is provided based on [inflow time]. (It is not provided based on payment time. In the [Sales Analysis > Product/Marketing Channel] report, payment and marketing channel inflow is based on ‘payment time’. It shows the relationship.) For more information about this, please refer to the help below. Why the payment amount for sales analysis and the payment amount for marketing analysis are different Go to Help ≫ 2) ‘Payment amount’ (conversion amount, conversion sales amount, etc.) in the advertising platform ‘Conversion Service’ ​Considering all marketing channel inflows to the site Unlike the analytics service, the conversion analysis service on the advertising platform only considers 'clicks/inflows that occurred on the relevant advertising platform'. In the case above, BizAdvisor statistics consider all five inflows, but the conversion of the advertising platform The analysis service only considers clicks/inflows from the relevant advertising platform. In the case above, in the case of [Naver Search Advertising Platform], only the marketing channels indicated below are considered, and within that, the marketing channel closest to payment is considered to have contributed 100%. (Naver Last-click attribution model, which considers only search ads and distributes 100% of the credit to the closest ad click among the ad clicks that occurred within 15 (or 20) days before payment) In the case above, in the case of [Never Performance Display Ad], the following Only the indicated marketing channels are considered, and the marketing channel closest to the payment is considered to have contributed 100%. ※ Note. - In the last click attribution model on the advertising platform, when a payment (conversion) occurs, the click/inflow from the advertising platform closest to the payment in the past 15 to 20 days is 100% contributed. Therefore, it does not matter if the advertisement clicks/inflow are not on the same date as the payment. - Whether or not you can see the clicks/inflow of the advertising platform up to the past few days from the payment (conversion) varies depending on the advertising platform, but it is usually about 15 to 20 days. no see. (Please refer to the help of the relevant advertising platform.) - In the advertising platform's report, ad clicks are shown on the click date, and payment (conversion) is shown on the payment (conversion) date. (In the case of BizAdvisor statistics, reports are displayed based on the inflow date in [Marketing Analysis], and reports are displayed based on payment date in [Sales Analysis]) Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)​Q1) In BizAdvisor Statistics, [Marketing Analysis>All Channels] In 'Naver Site Search Ad', payment is made, but no conversion to Naver Search Ad is detected. Why is that so? ​(a) You must check whether you are viewing payment information at the same time. - (a) The report under [Marketing Analysis] of BizAdvisor statistics provides information on the date of inflow. (The time of payment does not appear in this report.) - (b) The report under [Sales Analysis] of BizAdvisor statistics provides information on the date to which the time of payment belongs. - (c) The conversion analysis report of the advertising platform refers to the number of clicks on advertisements. Information is provided on the date when the advertisement is clicked, and payment (conversion) information is provided on the date when the payment occurs. (a) BizAdvisor Statistics' [Marketing Analysis] report and (c) the advertising platform's conversion analysis report are provided on the same date/ Even if you select a period, the information displayed for that date period is different. Because of this, the payment amount on the same date is often different. (b) Because the way to identify customers (users) in BizAdvisor and the way to identify customers in 'Naver Search Ads' are different, conversions may not be captured in Naver Search Ads. In 'Naver Search Advertising', when connecting an ad click and payment (conversion), if the terminal/browser where the ad click occurred and the terminal/browser where payment was made are different, the person who clicked on the ad and the person who made the payment are treated differently, so the ad and payment are connected. Since the payment (conversion) value is not given, BizAdvisor attaches a payment conversion value to the advertisement by finding as much information as possible about whether the terminal/browser on which the advertisement was clicked and the terminal/browser on which payment was made are different even if the terminal/browser on which the payment was made is different. There may be cases where the value is greater than the value in the Naver Search Ad (SA) report, or there is no conversion value in the Naver Search Ad (SA) report, but there is a conversion value in BizAdvisor. Q2) For the same period, BizAdvisor statistics [ In [Marketing Analysis > All Channels], the [Conversion Sales Amount] shown in the Naver Search Ad Ad Management Tool is larger than the [Payment (Last Click 0) payment amount for the same marketing channel [Naver Site Search Ad]. Why is this? A ) ​The payment amount shown in BizAdvisor statistics [Marketing Analysis] and the payment amount (conversion sales) of the advertising platform are different due to the differences mentioned above. Nevertheless, in the case of [Payment (Last Click)] in BizAdvisor statistics [Marketing Analysis] You can also compare with advertising platforms, but in the example below, we will only compare on April 15th, when payment occurred. In the case above, in [Payment (based on last click)] in BizAdvisor statistics [Marketing Analysis], (5) [Naver Shopping Search] takes 100% of the contribution, and the amount becomes 100,000 won, and (4) [Naver Shopping Search Advertisement] The contribution of 0 is 0%, or 0 won, but on the Naver search advertising platform, (4) [Naver Shopping Search Ad] takes 100% of the contribution, and the payment amount is 100,000 won. In this case, [Naver Search Advertising Platform] ]'s [Naver Shopping Search Ad]'s 'conversion sales' is 100,000 won, but in BizAdvisor statistics, the 'payment amount' is shown as 0 won, and the 'conversion sales' in [Naver search advertising platform] is KRW 100,000 in BizAdvisor statistics. 'It becomes bigger than that.

Payment amount standard for marketing analysis,"In reports under marketing analysis, only payment amounts related to marketing channels introduced during the selected viewing period are included in the (total) payment amount, and payments without marketing channel contribution are not included. Payment (based on last click) - Payment occurrence It shows the indicators based on the last marketing channel clicked just before. - The payment (based on last click) indicator counts the amount of payment made on the same day immediately after inflow through the relevant marketing channel. Example) If 50,000 won is paid after entering the site through Naver Shopping search advertisement and Naver site search advertisement on the same day, the payment amount of 50,000 won is captured only for 'Naver site search advertisement'. Payment (+14 days contribution estimate) - Marketing channel We track inflows for 14 days to show how much that channel contributed to payments. If multiple marketing channels contributed, one payment is shown divided into multiple channels. - This indicates the amount that the marketing channel contributed to the payment amount within 14 days from the marketing execution date. Example) Multiple marketing in one payment If a channel contributed, the payment amount is divided by channel according to the contribution rate. The buyer: ① 10/13 Search for a teddy bear through Naver search ads and access the store; ② 10/17 Search for a teddy bear through Naver Shopping search, then access the store and purchase the product. If you make a purchase, the marketing channel in the past 14 days of payment is considered to have contributed to the payment, and the payment amount is divided appropriately. (Example, Naver search advertisement 20,000 won / Naver shopping search 30,000 won) ※ Note. [Marketing Analysis] sub-reports are reports whose purpose is to show the performance of the 'inflow' that occurred in the selected period in terms of payment. (Payment information made without inflow does not appear) Information is provided based on [inflow time] to the site, and the 'inflow time' shows how much the inflow that occurred during the selected period contributed to subsequent payments. (It is difficult to identify information related to ‘payment time’ in the marketing analysis sub-report.)

I am curious as to the reason for ‘not meeting the start zero fee’ application conditions. (Unsatisfied Frequently Asked Questions),"​           Frequently asked questions regarding application conditions for zero start fee Q. What is the approval date for business registration? If you have two or more stores, the store that was approved first becomes the standard.■ When converting from an individual seller to a business, the date of membership approval is applied based on the date the seller signed up as an individual seller.■ By transfer and transfer. When operating stores with multiple accounts, the application is based on the store approved first, so if the acquired account does not meet the subscription approval date criteria, you cannot apply.Q. The business's sales grade (sprouts, seeds) is confirmed as 'unsatisfactory'.1. If less than one month has passed since you signed up, your actual grade is not reflected and you are exposed as unsatisfied. Please check next month. 2. If you operate multiple stores as a single business, you can apply for the start zero fee only if all stores meet the conditions.Example) A store: Sprout, B store: Application not possible in case of power level. ※ Note. · If one business operates multiple stores, only one store can apply. · If one representative operates multiple businesses, only one store of one business can apply. Q. I have reported sales to the National Tax Service and meet the National Tax Service's franchise rating (micro, small and medium 1), but it is confirmed as 'unsatisfactory'.

Additionally, in the case of the National Tax Service rating, if the representative is the same and is operating under multiple business registration numbers, the sales of all businesses in operation are added together and included in the rating application criteria. Example) · January sales report: Start zero from July 1 of the relevant year Fee application available · July sales report: Starting from January 1 of the following year Zero fee application available Details of grading criteria based on sales volume For businesses with reporting history to the National Tax Service during the ‘period subject to grading data’ Total reported to the National Tax Service Based on the sales amount, the rating is calculated for the first/second half of the year, and for businesses whose business period is less than 1 year during the rating calculation period, the rating is calculated separately according to the National Tax Service's own calculation method (detailed standards must be confirmed with the National Tax Service) ‘Period subject to rating data’ If there is no sales amount reported to the National Tax Service, the rating for the first and second half is calculated based on sales details sold through open markets (including third parties) and PG companies in the previous half year (6 months) regardless of business type Q. What should I do when the conditions for small business sales channel support status are displayed as “not met”? Naver is working with various local government organizations to carry out an online sales channel support project for small business owners.

"[Fulfillment] What is the difference between available inventory quantity, working inventory quantity, and sellable inventory quantity?","The available inventory quantity is the sellable quantity of the SKU. The working inventory quantity is the quantity ordered out of the sellable quantity of the SKU. At the time an order is placed, inventory is deducted from the available inventory quantity by the order quantity, and the working inventory quantity is increased. The shipment quantity per order is the quantity that is picked and shipped for the corresponding SKU when 1 order is received. ex) If the shipment quantity per order = 3, when the buyer orders 1 SKU, 3 SKUs are shipped. The available inventory quantity is also deducted by 3. The sellable inventory quantity is the quantity that a buyer can actually purchase for a product or option, and is the quantity obtained by subtracting the order quantity generated from the smart store from the available inventory quantity linked from the logistics company. Mapped. It corresponds to the minimum value among the calculated values ​​of 'Available inventory quantity ÷ Shipping quantity per order' of existing SKUs. The sellable inventory quantity is different from the actual inventory quantity in the logistics center due to differences in processing time of the inventory interlocking system between the smart store and the logistics company. It may be different.ex) When an order is placed, the smart store deducts inventory in real time, but the logistics company deducts inventory at the time of order collection and shipping, so the inventory quantity is exhausted before the logistics company system. Logistics company-Naver uses real-time However, due to some reasons, the inventory quantity displayed on the screen may differ from the inventory quantity exposed to the logistics company's WMS. - Naver provides real-time tracking at the time an order/cancellation occurs. This is reflected in the inventory quantity, but the logistics company collects orders at a certain cycle and reflects them in the logistics company's inventory. Due to this time difference, there may be differences in inventory. - If the seller independently processes orders that must be shipped by the logistics company by setting them as fulfillment, there may be differences in inventory. - In addition, there may be differences in inventory between the two companies' systems. Temporary system errors may occur during the linking process, resulting in differences in inventory.

If the product that was already being sold as a 1+1 deal is the same as the representative option for which you want to proceed with the One Plus Deal, you can offer the product as is in the One Plus Deal. ※ reference. · One Place Deal ‘Sales Proposal’ is the stage of proposing a competitive product that can be sold at One Place Deal. There is no need for the product to be registered or on sale in advance before making the offer. · If you change the configuration of an existing single sale product to 1+1, it may be considered “reuse of product ID” and the product may be deleted, so be sure to register it as a new product. Example) It is impossible to change the product code that was previously selling 1 frying pan to 1 frying pan + 1 in order to proceed with a one-place deal. Also, although it was registered as a 'new product', the option for the product says 'previously sold'. If 'product' is included, the selling price of the existing product must be even 10 won lower to not be considered a duplicate ID. Example) A seller who was previously selling products A, B, and C creates a new 1+1 configuration with product D. When proposing a full deal, if one of the previously sold options A, B, or C is included as an additional option in the options of the new product, the option price must be set differently from the existing selling price.

It appears, and in fact, both the product duplicate coupon (A) and the store duplicate discount coupon can be applied, so the actual purchaser is 8,000 won.

If you wish to proceed with the same product again, please propose again 30 days from the end date of the original product. ※ Note. 'No duplicate offers for 30 days for the same product' is judged based on the product ID (product number), so if it is a different product, it does not constitute a duplicate. 'No duplicate offers for the same product for 30 days' suggests a wider variety of products and offers to all sellers. This is to ensure that exposure is given as fair an opportunity as possible, and if it is suspected or judged to be abusing, it may not be inspected and may not be exposed.

Example of applying a live special price > Selling price 10,000 won / Instant discount 1,000 won = 9,000 won For products on sale, 12/24 12: 00~13:00 'Live special price' discount set to 2,000 won / 'Discount after special price ends' set to 0 won -> 12/24 12:00~13:00 Live special price period 8,000 won exposed (existing instant discount amount Including live special prices applied based on the sales price, not discounts) After the special price ends, the sales price of 10,000 won will be exposed ! Caution. After setting a special price for product 1 in A Live, A Live has not started yet, but if you link the same product to B Live and set a special price, the special price applied to A Live will disappear. The special price set last is confirmed as the final price. You can think of it as a special price. It applies not only to live shows, but also to short clip discount one-player deal events and rehearsals. Special prices cannot be set differently for each area. If the price changes in live, the price also changes in the store. Example> Set a special price on 111111 live at 10:00AM, then run 222222 broadcast (rehearsal) at 11:00AM to rehearse the broadcast, link the same product, set a special price, and select the option to 'Apply special price until the end of the live' (=This broadcast 222222 means a rehearsal broadcast, that is, the live end point of this broadcast means the rehearsal end time) When the 111111 live main broadcast is performed again at 12:00 PM, the special price settings need to be rechecked. 6) Live special price application LIVE special price stickers are displayed only when a live special price is set. LIVE special price stickers are not displayed for products that are immediately discounted in Smart Store.
■ How to change special price settings when live is deleted or terminated 1. Create a rehearsal, change special price settings, and link the desired product2. Please set a special price for the linked product for the desired period and price range3. Once you start and end rehearsal, you can change the special price settings.

[Live Notices and Operational Policies] Frequently asked questions regarding categories subject to review,"Where should I receive live review? Health functional foods must be obtained from the Korea Health Functional Foods Association, special-use foods and functionally declared foods must be obtained from the Korea Food Industry Association, and medical devices must be obtained from the Korea Medical Device Industry Association. Since the Health Functional Food Association does not review the contents of medical devices, special-purpose foods, and functionally labeled foods, if more than one deliberation category product is linked/progressed in one live, a script must be submitted separately to the association for review. Example) When conducting a live A live by linking omega-3 products, which are healthy foods, and shakes, which are special-purpose foods (prepared foods for weight control), a script must be written and reviewed by the Health Functional Foods Association and the Korea Food Industry Association. . (A total of two deliberation passes are required to be submitted) Go to Korea Health Functional Food Association>Consumer Public Interest Network (New Health Functional Food Review Organization) Go>Go to Korea Food Industry Association>Go to Korea Medical Device Industry Association>​Korea Medical Services Go to Industrial Cooperative > Can I only receive review once? After passing live review through a related organization, you can conduct multiple live shows or post short clips under the assumption that the same content will be carried out. However, if there is a change in content/comments, a reconsideration must be conducted with the relevant organization. ※Reference. In the case of short clips, the content and comments are completely different from live, so a new review is required. (However, if some sections of the live content are used as is without editing, re-deliberation is not required) What materials should be submitted for review? Both the live script and the panel require review. If a panel is not used, only the script review is required. This is possible. In the case of short clips, video review is the basis, but in the case of short clips with comments, script review is conducted. Even if a notice of implementation has been received from the relevant organization for deliberation on the video that is part of the live video, the audio script review certificate for the insert video or TV commercial video cannot be considered as having received a notice of implementation for the live execution, so it will be rejected when submitted to the Naver form.※ reference. Review of the product detail page or the product itself does not mean review of the live advertisement. Live content must be reviewed. Can I only submit the review pass once to Naver Shopping Live? No, you must submit and pre-register for each live and short clip content. Even if you have previously received a confirmation email with the same review pass, you can submit a new live or short clip content only once. In the case of a short clip number, if it is not submitted in advance, it will be considered as unconfirmed content that has passed review and its exposure will be limited. Click here to pre-submit a document that has passed review > What is the time required for review and review submitted on Naver Form? Submitted before 12:00 p.m. In such cases, we try to ensure that inspection is carried out on the same day as much as possible. If submitted after 12 o'clock, inspection will be carried out sequentially on the next business day, and requests for advance processing through customer service or email are absolutely impossible. Considering the parts that may be rejected, please schedule a generous schedule for submission and submission. Please proceed. If each product has a previously reviewed certificate of approval, do I not need to undergo re-examination? If I continue to mention the content that was previously reviewed, I do not need to undergo re-examination. However, if content is partially extracted here and there from the reviewed scripts and used as a new script or content, it is necessary to apply for change review or proceed with re-deliberation. Even product linkage and exposure, without mention in live and short clips, must be reviewed. Is it possible? Just linking/exposing a product to live is considered an advertisement. Only products that have passed deliberation can be linked to Live or Short Clip. If the product is only linked/exposed without a comment, please submit a change deliberation application to the relevant agency. If there is no or no mention of a deliberation pass, or the relevant agency rejects deliberation If so, please cancel the link. When receiving deliberation, which type of display and advertising media should be selected, such as video, home shopping, or the Internet? If the deliberation on the script and panel (and video to be used during live, etc.) is correct, the media type does not matter. No. I already have a product to add to Kim's Live that has been inspected on Naver. Can I just proceed? No, even if you have already inspected (pre-registered), if you have a special food group product to add, you must specify the relevant information and resubmit. Even if additional products are registered without prior sharing after receiving the review and inspection confirmation email, the live exposure will be limited. It seems that the review pass will be issued late in the live progress schedule or short clip posting date. Is it possible to postpone it? No, in advance of live advertisement execution. It is mandatory to receive it. Even if you receive a 'fulfillment' result after passing the deliberation, the fact that it is illegal due to the failure to proceed with prior deliberation does not change. Is there any problem if I delete the live or short clip that has not been deliberated? Even if I delete the content, the deliberation is not in progress. There is no change in the fact that it is illegal to conduct a live broadcast, and the responsibility lies with the seller. Even if you delete the live broadcast, the fact that the violation is in progress does not change, and it is not possible to delete the penalty history. Can live and short clips that were not aware of the deliberation or were released before Naver's announcement be exempt from penalty application? Even if you are not aware of the deliberation in advance, you will not be treated as an exception. However, for the number of violations prior to notification, only the exposure limit for the relevant live and short clips is applied and does not affect the transmission authority restriction penalty. Guidance on the required review process for special food groups and medical devices has been provided in various areas. (i) Smart Store Center announcement (ii) Posting of banner at the top of the Shopping Live Studio app start button (more than 1 month) (iii) Naver Business School training (iv) Shopping Window official blog and shopping partner official blog post (v) Deliberation Cautionary pop-up notification every time a target product is linked. This regulation was enacted/implemented before the start of the Naver Shopping Live service, so sellers running related businesses must be aware of and comply with it. Live proceedings subject to deliberation, such as health functional foods Is it possible to link with city general foods? Yes, it is possible. After passing review by the association, it is possible to link general food or products to the live that has been inspected through Naver Form. However, on the contrary, deliberation is required to add products subject to deliberation to general product sales live. step. If the purpose is to sell a general food together with a health functional food so that the general food is mistaken for a functional food, linking to exaggerate the effect of the food is not possible. Example >- If you eat A, a general food, with B, a health food, it cannot be sold by linking it together to make it look functional or mentioned. - A, a general food, cannot be linked together to make it appear as one of the health food products. Short clips are also not reviewed. Do I need to receive it? Yes, if the product subject to review is linked or the content of the short clip is related to the product subject to review, it is all subject to review. Only the video length is different from the live one, and the short clip is also a separate advertisement. Even if you have received live review, if the content of the short clip section is not included in the live review pass, you must undergo additional review. If I only offer a product subject to review as a free gift without selling/linking it, do I not need to undergo review? Even if I provide a product subject to review as a free gift, I must have a relevant sales license. Even if it is provided only as a free gift, if it does not simply state the product name or if there is any explanation about the product, please proceed with review. Example) (Assuming that a free health meal is provided during general food sales) We will also send you ___product name____ as a free gift! > As a gift for If not, a pop-up with deliberation-related information appears, just click Agree and proceed. Even in the same category or product group, there are cases where the product is subject to review and cases where it is not. In Naver Shopping, products are divided only by category, and there is no division into whether a single product is subject to review or not. Therefore, if the product belongs to a category that includes the product subject to deliberation, a deliberation-related pop-up appears. Example> Both regular stockings and medical compression stockings are in the [Fashion>Stockings] category, and since general stockings and medical compression stockings are not classified into separate categories, a review pass is not submitted in advance to the Naver form while guidance regarding review is in progress for the entire category. What should I do if my live is not exposed or I receive a penalty? STEP 1. Please submit the review pass you have to Naver Form. STEP 2. When you receive the inspection pass email, STEP 3. (1) If you submitted the pre-ad review pass: Explanation will be processed automatically within a maximum of 1 business day. (2) After the inspection, please submit the review pass.

If you submit an explanation containing specific future improvement plans, you can apply for additional review by a person in charge.

We are giving it to you. Receiving an email that has passed the inspection does not automatically change the status to live or channel restrictions. The results of the deliberations on the same day are transferred to the explanation processing department at 6 p.m., and explanation processing is applied sequentially thereafter. If you do not receive the status change email by 6 PM the day after receiving the pass email, you can request to check the progress through a 1:1 inquiry at the customer center. For sellers who do not want to experience delays like the above, the live will not be exposed. Before processing, please follow the review submission process with sufficient time in advance of the live event. What are the penalties for failure to comply with deliberation? Each live violation is considered one violation. 1 case of violation live performance: Not exposed to the relevant live + 1-day transmission restriction and warning 2 cases: Not exposed to the relevant live + 1-month transmission restriction and warning 3 cases: Not exposed to the relevant live + permanent transmission restriction [Review] If you have a medical device manufacturing license, a sales business license Do I need to submit a sales license?

[Shopping Live Special Price] What should I do if the special price is not applied during live?,"If you set the live special price incorrectly, you can correct it immediately in the Shopping Live Studio app, or edit/register it through the Shopping Live web management tool.※ Note - If you set an immediate discount rather than a live special price, the LIVE special price sticker will not be displayed. - There may be a delay of up to 25 minutes when the LIVE special price is reflected after an immediate discount modification! Things to keep in mind when setting a special price: After setting a special price for Product 1 in A Live, if A Live has not started yet, but you link the same product to B Live and set a special price, the special price applied to A Live will disappear. You can consider the special price set last as the final confirmed special price. The same applies not only to live groups, but also to one-party deal events, etc. Example > For a short clip discount, price discount adjustment is set in the Smart Store Center until 10:00 a.m. the next day > To increase the effect on the day of discount exposure, it is decided to go live, so a special price for 1 product is set again in Live A = Live When the special price set in A is finally applied and the live ends, the special price also ends.

Naver Shopping Live Is the solution a paid service? The Naver Shopping Live solution does not charge separate development fees or usage fees, and a partial sales commission will be charged depending on the scope of service use. ※ Note. The Shopping Live solution can be selected depending on the smart store seller level. Available packages vary, and depending on each package, a solution usage fee is charged only for smart store sales resulting from Shopping Live inflow. The Shopping Live solution usage fee is not charged in addition to the existing Shopping Live fee, and only the maximum fee is charged. This is a concept that is charged. For more information about the usage fee for each Shopping Live solution package, please refer to Article 6, Paragraph 1 of the Shopping Live Terms of Use. Do I have to have Naver’s Smart Store? Yes, I am currently using Naver’s Shopping Live solution. To do this, you need an operating Smart Store or Brand Store account. If you do not have an operating store, we will provide guidance on opening a store through partnership inquiry. Can the viewer expose products registered in the company's mall? A solution that exposes the products in the company's mall to members of the company's mall for a specific inflow path, only for sellers who meet the Shopping Live performance/activity standards and smart store rating standards We will provide support for the package. (However, when accessed from Shopping Live, it is exposed as a smart store product.) Is it necessary to transmit simultaneously with Naver Shopping Live? The Naver Shopping Live solution has a policy of basic broadcasting of Shopping Live. Accordingly, in the management tool, you can set “Simultaneous transmission of Shopping Live + Own Mall” or “Simultaneous transmission of Shopping Live” on a live basis. Is simultaneous transmission possible on external live platforms in addition to Naver Shopping Live and Company Mall? No, this solution Only supports simultaneous transmission of Naver Shopping Live and its own mall. Please note that transmitting external services is not possible due to operational policy. Do I need a developer to use the Naver Shopping Live solution? No, this solution is intended to support smart store sellers using Naver Shopping Live to easily utilize Shopping Live and expand sales channels. It has begun. Accordingly, simple exposure linkage that can expose customized viewers in the company's mall can be applied without a developer, and a detailed linkage guide is provided for this. How long does it take to link Naver Shopping Live solution? Separate exhibition and back-office API linkage If you only link the web viewer without this, integration is possible in about 1 week, and even if you link the completed web viewer, native viewer SDK, and API, development is possible in a short period of about 2-3 weeks. What is the native viewer SDK? Is it? If you have your own mall application, the application provides an SDK (Software Development Kit) so that you can apply an app viewer that provides optimized usage for the app rather than a web viewer. Through this, all of Naver Shopping Live's advanced viewer functions can be easily applied with few resources. By applying the native viewer, not only does the company's mall app operate more stably than the web viewer, but it can also provide additional features that can only be used in the app, such as PIP mode and real-time zoom. What is the exhibition API and how is it linked? Is this possible? In order to implement a live exhibition page for our company mall, we need a variety of information that can be exposed. Naver Shopping Live Solution API provides the ability to display values ​​directly set in Shopping Live, such as broadcast name, thumbnail image, start time, and preview page, on the company's mall, as well as live video, number of viewers, number of likes, etc. Real-time information is also delivered, so you can flexibly configure the screen with information provided through the API. Through this, you can link the API directly to the service screen of your own mall to be exposed as soon as you set it on Shopping Live, or set the exposure yourself. If you want to provide such, it is also possible to implement it to link with the back office of your own mall. Do members of your own mall need to log in to Naver to use the viewer? Unlike Naver Shopping Live, the solution viewer that will be provided to your own mall requires Naver login. You can chat/like/enter product details without doing so. Is it possible to send a notification to your company's mall members as well? When a live game starts, the details of the occurrence will be transmitted from the shopping live server to the company's mall server (callback event provided). When you receive this information, you can automatically send a notification to those who have agreed to receive marketing from your company's mall. (For subscribers to Naver's existing channels, the same Naver notification will be sent)What shopping live solution packages are available? There are three major shopping live solution packages, and the seller can select one depending on the smart store seller level. The range of packages varies. Each package application can be selected by the seller when applying for the live solution, and in the case of signing up for the Cafe24 Shopping Live Solution app, any seller with Big Power or higher will automatically sign up for the standard package. 1) Light package: Available for use at Smart Store Sprout level or higher / Only simultaneous transmission and archiving of shopping live content to the company's mall is possible. When you click the purchase product on the company's mall live viewer, you will be taken to the Smart Store purchase page. If a purchase occurs through this, a 5% shopping live solution usage fee is charged regardless of whether or not the shopping live calendar is exposed. 2) Standard package: Available at Smart Store Big Power level or higher / Simultaneous transmission and archiving of shopping live content to the company's mall You can also set it so that when you click the purchase button on the live viewer of your own mall in a 'replay' state, you will be taken to the purchase page of your own mall set by the seller. The fee for using the Shopping Live solution is charged only for Smart Store sales through Live, and the commission rate is 7%.3) Pro Package: Available only to brand store sellers through an internal review process through a separate partnership proposal. ※ Please note. . Naver Shopping Live Viewer, which is broadcast simultaneously with the company's mall live, can only connect to the Smart Store purchase page and cannot connect to the company's mall purchase page. Once I select a usage package, can I change it? No. After signing up for the Shopping Live solution, you can set and change the exposure of your own mall for each live and whether or not you connect to the purchase of products from your own mall for each live. An individual commission is charged for each live option set by the seller, depending on the seller's sales strategy. You can utilize this accordingly. For example, if a seller who subscribes to the standard package does not expose A Live on their own mall and only broadcasts it on Naver Shopping Live, the existing Shopping Live commission rate will be applied (3% or 5%), and B Live is exposed to the company's mall, and if the purchase of the company's mall product is connected to the smart store, a solution usage fee of 5% is charged. C Live is exposed to the company's mall, and if the purchase of the company's mall product is connected to the company's mall purchase page, the smart store A 7% solution usage fee is charged for sales generated through Shopping Live. If the smart store seller rating falls, the Shopping Live solution usage package is also adjusted according to the rating.

SDK is provided for iOS and Android, and when linked through native viewer, you can use the following functions. PIP mode is provided as standard, so you can explore other screens within the app or watch live/short clips even when the app is closed. By receiving information generated from the viewer (callback), you can view live/short clips in the company's mall app. You can implement your own mall specifications tailored to the clip. For example, various implementations are possible, such as displaying a specific pop-up at the start and end of a broadcast, or providing points to customers who watch for more than 3 minutes. For detailed information required for development, please refer to [Management Tools > Solutions > Development Guide]. Q.

[Web management tool] Web management tool statistics inflow path analysis method,"Currently, Shopping Live Web Management Tool > Statistics supports analysis of the number of unique views by inflow path. In addition to the inflow path defined in Shopping Live, sellers can check statistics by defining the inflow path themselves. <Web management tool> Statistics> Example of screen providing the total number of unique views by inflow path> ■ Aggregation criteria 1. When entering the viewing screen, it is counted according to the parameters included in the entry URL, and the parameter composition is as follows. * Parameter: means variable. If you specify a different variable value for each inflow route and include it after the url, you can separately count the number of inflows containing that variable. 2. Parameters defined by Naver are exposed as Korean names in the web management tool. 3. If Naver does not define it, the URL parameter name is exposed as is in the web management tool. 4. When the same user visits multiple times, only one visit is counted based on the last parameter entered. ■ Custom Settings 1. Define the fm (major category) / sn (middle category) / ea (small category) parameters that you want to classify and aggregate. (Example) Comparison of the efficiency of two advertising spaces A & B conducted for Live ID 12345. 1) “Marketing page A” “Banner” advertisement 2) “Push notification” advertisement for the “video banner” of “Marketing Page B” ​ * Define by parameter (Afterwards, you can freely set the value you want to check directly in the management tool statistics.) 2. Shopping Live Add after URL Add after {Shopping Live URL}+{?}+{fm= }+{&}+{sn= }+{&}+{ea= }※ Note. In the case of a short clip, parameters are added to the short clip URL in the same format. Example) https://view.shoppinglive.naver.com/shortclips/{short clip id}?fm=marketingA&sn=banner ※ Note. 1. Only English letters/numbers/special characters such as underbar (_) and hyphen (-) can be used in parameter values. (Korean not allowed) If characters other than these are present, inflow analysis may not be possible or an error may occur. If the number of characters in the parameter value is too long (more than 100 characters), it may also affect the analysis. We recommend that you define it simply and clearly. 2. When setting the URL address of a hyperlink, be careful not to enter “?” more than once. If there is already a question mark (?) in the URL, leave only the question mark and replace the last part with an and (&).3. Parameters can be aggregated even if only some (fm, sn) are used. 1) Only FM (main category) and sn (medium category) are used. Total number of inflows that entered the on-air screen through “push” sent from “Marketing Page ABC”. https://view.shoppinglive.naver.com/lives/{broadcast id }?fm=ABC&sn=push 2) Use only FM (main categories) ​ Total number of inflows that entered the on-air screen through “Marketing Page ABC” ​ https://view.shoppinglive.naver.com/lives/{broadcast id}?fm =ABC4. Shopping Live URL standards apply as follows. 1) Preview page: https://shoppinglive.naver.com/livebridge/{live id} 2) On-air viewer: https://view.shoppinglive.naver.com/lives/{live id} 3) Replay viewer: https://view.shoppinglive.naver.com/replays/{Live ID} 4) Short Clip Viewer: https://view.shoppinglive.naver.com/shortclips/{Short Clip ID} 5) How to find Live ID: https://help.naver.com/service/21349/contents/12538?lang=ko■ Web management tool Statistics funnel analysis method Frequently asked questions 1. Entering another live with parameters (fm, sn, ea) Afterwards, if you go live while checking statistics, previous parameter values ​​may be aggregated. Example) If a user who entered another live with fm=a in a media A advertisement entered my live by swiping (moving the screen up and down to move between lives), the user would be counted as a in my live as well. Example) If you enter the short clip of your channel through receiving live notifications from another channel or another live on the Naver app, receiving live notifications may be counted in your short clip statistics. 2. The number of views displayed on the shopping live screen is counted as logged in + non-logged unique visitors. Unlike the number of views, inflow is counted only for cases with an inflow path, so even if you add up the number of unique views for each inflow path, it may not be the same as the total number of views. Example) When logged in viewer A → enters viewer number 2: Viewed views are counted as 1. Login viewer A → Viewer enters through A path: Views inflow through A path are counted as 1 · Login viewer A → Viewer enters through B path: Views inflow through B path Counted as 1
